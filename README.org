Common Lisp library for accessing Finnish Meteorological Institute's weather
observations

- See <http://ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/latauspalvelun-beta> for API details.
- The library is very much work in progress and only implements the
  =fmi::observations::weather::realtime::place::multipointcoverage= query with
  a fixed timestep and can only be parameterized by a place-name.
- Given these limitations, it should be trivial to extend, although the XML
  format is quite baroque and is the most complicated thing in the process of
  implementing new queries.
