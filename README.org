Common Lisp library for accessing Finnish Meteorological Institute's weather
observations

- See <http://ilmatieteenlaitos.fi/latauspalvelun-beta> for API details.
- The library is very much work in progress and only implements the
  =fmi::observations::weather::realtime::place::multipointcoverage= that can
  only be parameterized by timestep and place-name.
- Given these limitations, it should be quite easy to extend.  XML format is
  quite baroque and is the most complicated step in adding new query support.
